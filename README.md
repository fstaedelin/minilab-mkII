import the minilab mk 2 memory in your midi control center.

put the device_Minilab MK2.py file in your Flstudio hardware folder. (generally in documents/image-line/FL studio/settings/hardware make a folder called Arturia Minilab MK2 there and put the file there).

then select the script from your midi settings in fl studio.

here are the bindings:
Knob 1: select mixer channel
Knob 1 press: Play
Knob 9 press: Stop
Knob 8: control volume of selected mixer channel
Knob 16: control panning of selected mixer channel
Knob 7: seek in playlist
Knob 15: seek in playlist(finer control)
Pad 1: solo selected mixer track
Pad 2: mute selected mixer track
Pad 3: enable record
Pad 4: toggle song mode and pattern mode
Pad 5: reset volume and pan of selected mixer channel
Pad 6: open piano roll
Pad 7: open channel rack
Pad 8: open mixer.

These are the controls that I use the most and thus made a script that lets me use these without having to click too many buttons. If you like the script follow me on instagram @ its_hyde
